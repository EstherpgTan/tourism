I drew plans for each page: "landing", "getting", "gallery" and "contact". Then proceeded to write the HTML for the page.

I planned the appropriate div's. Then followed writing the CSS for each page.

I then went back over the individual page and added the links for pictures to the carousel and gallery.

I then went back over each page to ensure it was responsive and to rewrite the syntax for the SCSS file.
